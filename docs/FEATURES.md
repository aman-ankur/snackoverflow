- Fridge analysis: Gemini 2.0 Flash → Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite → Groq Llama 4 Scout
- Dish camera scan: Gemini 2.5 Flash → Gemini 2.0 Flash → Groq Llama 4 Scout
- Describe meal: Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite → OpenAI gpt-4.1-nano + Groq Llama 4 Scout (parallel race)
- Eating habits analysis: Gemini 2.5 Flash → OpenAI gpt-4.1-mini → Groq Llama 4 Scout

- Hindi TTS: Sarvam AI only (native Hindi voice)

## 12. Cost Controls
- Image downscaling to max width 512px and JPEG compression before AI requests
- Dish scan endpoint includes short-lived in-memory cache for repeated near-identical scans
- Describe-meal endpoint includes 5-minute in-memory cache (200 entries max)
- Manual-scan-only dish mode avoids uncontrolled background token usage
- Describe-meal uses Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite (separate 15 RPM quota from camera scanner's 2.5 Flash)
- OpenAI + Groq raced in parallel (first valid response wins, no sequential waiting)
- 6-second per-provider timeout prevents slow providers from blocking the pipeline
- **Eating analysis**: client-side pre-aggregation reduces AI input from ~3000-5000 tokens (raw meals) to ~400 tokens (compact summary). 95%+ of calls use Gemini free tier ($0.00). Smart caching avoids re-generation when no new meals logged.

## 14. Capy's Garden — 8-Milestone Progression System (NEW)

- **Condition status**: `"active"` (user has it), `"family_history"` (runs in family), or `"both"` (user has it AND family history)
- Inline "Me" (red pill) and "Family" (amber pill) toggles per condition — can select both simultaneously
- "Family" pill only shown for conditions where `hasFamilyHistory: true` (not shown for pregnancy, menopause, IBS, lactose intolerance, celiac, iron/vitamin D deficiency)

## 19. Eating Habits Analysis — AI-Powered Reports (NEW)

### Overview
AI-generated eating habits report that analyzes logged meals over a selectable time window, cross-referenced with health profile data, producing actionable insights. Optimized for minimal token cost via client-side pre-aggregation.

### Trigger Points
- **Progress tab**: Prominent "Eating Habits Analysis" card below Weekly Calories chart with time-window segmented control (Today / 7 Days / 14 Days / 30 Days) and "Analyze My Eating" button
- **Home tab**: Summary card showing latest report score + one-liner summary. Tapping navigates to Progress tab. Only visible if a report was generated in the last 7 days.

### Time Windows
- **Today** — useful after logging multiple meals in a day
- **7 Days** — weekly check-in (default selection)
- **14 Days** — bi-weekly trend analysis
- **30 Days** — monthly review

### Cost-Optimized Architecture
The key design decision: **all number crunching happens client-side** via `mealAggregator.ts`. The AI receives a compact ~400-token summary instead of raw meal JSON (~3000-5000 tokens). This reduces cost by ~10x.

Client-side pre-computation includes:
- Daily calorie/macro totals and averages
- Goal adherence rate (days within 80-105% of calorie target)
- Weekend vs weekday calorie averages
- Meal timing stats (breakfast skip count, late dinner count)
- Top 10 dishes by frequency with average calories
- Macro ratio split (protein/carbs/fat percentages)
- Protein clustering at dinner percentage
- Snack calorie percentage of total
- Fried item count (from dish tags and name matching)
- Best/worst day by distance from calorie goal
- Unique dish count (variety metric)

### AI Report Structure
The AI returns a structured JSON report with:
- **Score**: `great` | `good` | `needs_work` | `concerning`
- **Score Summary**: 1-2 sentence mixed-tone assessment (data-first with warm encouragement)
- **Macro Trends**: per-macro direction (improving / stable / declining)
- **5-7 Insights** (dynamically selected from data):
  - **Temporal**: weekend calorie spikes, breakfast skipping impact, late dinners, snack clustering
  - **Macro**: protein distribution across meals, carb-heavy days, invisible snack calories, fiber gaps
  - **Variety**: diet monotony, repeat offenders, missing food groups
  - **Goal**: calorie target adherence, protein shortfall, best/worst day
- **Health Notes**: condition-specific observations (only when health profile exists)
  - Connects eating patterns to conditions (e.g. sodium + hypertension, GI + diabetes)
- **Action Items**: 3-5 prioritized, practical Indian food swaps (paneer, makhana, brown rice, etc.)
- **Period Comparison**: week-over-week delta when previous report exists

### Tabbed Bottom Sheet UI
Report displayed in a bottom sheet (consistent with MealTypeSheet pattern) with 4 tabs:
- **Summary**: Score badge, 1-2 sentence summary, macro trend pills (arrows), comparison card (if previous report exists)
- **Patterns**: Scrollable insight cards with severity color-coding (green=positive, grey=neutral, orange=warning)
- **Health**: Condition-specific notes (tab hidden if no health profile)
- **Actions**: Numbered priority action items with related insight references

### Smart Caching
- Last 10 analyses stored per user in `user_data.meal_analyses` (Supabase JSONB)
- Cache check: if same window was analyzed and no new meals logged since, shows cached report with "Generated Xh ago" badge
- "Refresh" button available to force re-generation
- "New meals logged" indicator when cached report is stale

### Provider Chain
- **Tier 1**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (free tier, 500 req/day) — best quality for health reasoning
- **Tier 2**: OpenAI gpt-4.1-mini (~$0.0015/call) — strong fallback with good insight depth
- **Tier 3**: Groq Llama 4 Scout (free) — emergency fallback, adequate for structured reports
- Temperature: 0.3 (factual, consistent)
- Max output tokens: 1200
- Per-provider timeout: 15 seconds

### Cost Profile
- 95%+ of calls: **$0.00** (Gemini free tier)
- Rare fallback: **~$0.0015** (gpt-4.1-mini)
- Emergency: **$0.00** (Groq free tier)
- Estimated input: ~450 tokens, output: ~900 tokens per analysis

### Files
- `mealAggregator.ts` — client-side pre-aggregation engine (`aggregateMeals()` + `serializeForPrompt()`)
- `useEatingAnalysis.ts` — React hook (state, cache logic, staleness detection, Supabase sync)
- `api/analyze-habits/route.ts` — POST route with 3-tier provider chain
- `EatingAnalysisSheet.tsx` — tabbed bottom sheet (Summary / Patterns / Health / Actions)
- `EatingAnalysisCard.tsx` — trigger card with time-window picker for Progress tab
- Types in `dishTypes.ts`: `EatingAnalysis`, `EatingReport`, `ReportInsight`, `ActionItem`, `PeriodComparison`, `MacroTrends`
